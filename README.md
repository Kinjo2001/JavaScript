# JavaScript
I'm studying JavaScript from the ground up. Although I have past programming experience, we will go through all topics in great detail in order to make it easier for folks who have no prior programming experience to comprehend. There are notes to follow, exercises with solutions, and projects to help you review what you've learned.
